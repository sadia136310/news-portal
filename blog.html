    <main>
        <h4>1. What's the difference between var, let and const?</h4>
        <p>Ans : var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not
            re-declared; const
            variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while
            var
            variables are initialized with undefined , let and const variables are not initialized</p>

        <h4>2.What's the difference between regular and arrow function? </h4>
        <p>Ans:Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable.
            Since regular
            functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only
            callable
            and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.</p>
        <h4>3.What's the difference between forEach,map,filter and find?</h4>
        <p>Ans:
            .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and
            it returns
            undefined.
            <br>
            .map():
            .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated
            elements.
            <br>
            .filter():
            .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array
            with the
            elements that return truthy for the criteria.
            <br>
            .find()
            Function .find() is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small detail â€” this
            function returns
            only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will return the first that
            has matched.
        </p>

        <h4>4.Why should we use template string?</h4>
        <p>Ans:Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
            insert/interpolate variables
            and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows
            us to create
            strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements</p>
