        <h4>1. What's the difference between var, let and const?</h4>
        <p>Ans : var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not
            re-declared; const
            variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while
            var
            variables are initialized with undefined , let and const variables are not initialized</p>

        <h4>2.What's the difference between regular and arrow function? </h4>
        <p>Ans:Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable.
            Since regular
            functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only
            callable
            and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.</p>
